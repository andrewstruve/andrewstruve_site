      <description>A common type of app that is always useful is a menu app. We can create a command line application that stays open and we can interact with it. I have used menu based apps to turn on and off pins on a microcontroller.
We will use python for this application.
Lets create a menu that does the following things:
 Set a Start Time (0) Get Time Elasped Since Start Time (1) Get Current time (2) Exit (3)  First we start with declaring our dependencies.</description>

      <description>This is the beginning. The title is so generic.
On this blog I plan to work on some projects and share them with you. I love writing good software and sharing it with others. Nothing is more frustrating than searching around the internet for things that should be simple but are difficult to find. If I can help share something that someone is struggling with, then I am glad to help.</description>
