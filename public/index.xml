      <description>This is the beginning. The title is so generic.
On this blog I plan to work on some projects and share them with you. I love writing good software and sharing it with others. Nothing is more frustrating than searching around the internet for things that should be simple but are difficult to find. If I can help share something that someone is struggling with, then I am glad to help.</description>
