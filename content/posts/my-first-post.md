This is the beginning. The title is so generic.

On this blog I plan to work on some projects and share them
with you. I love writing good software and sharing it with others.
Nothing is more frustrating than searching around the internet for
things that should be simple but are difficult to find. If I can 
help share something that someone is struggling with, then I am glad
to help. 

I work on a WIDE variety of code on Embedded Controllers and PCs.
- Arduino and STM32 Microcontroller programming.
- C/C++
- C#
- Java
- Python
- PHP
- Javascript
- Shell Scripting


- I have built CAN networks for vehicle communication.
- I have done data analysis on real time network traffic.
- I have tested simulated vehicles and created html reports. 
- I have been involved in automated vehicles. 
- I have created web servers.
- I have worked with mysql and mongoDB databases.
- So... yea, I do a lot of different things with software.

I love writing software that is useful and achieves a goal.
